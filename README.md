**Introduction**: Project was focused to predict Air Quality in terms of pm 2.5, data has 8 features as input. An ann was developed using tensorflow to solve the regression problem with keras tuner to search best number of neurons, hyperperameter, number of layers. 

**Technologies**: A few libraries and techs used in project
1. Jupyter notebook
2. Python 3.6
3. Pandas
4. Tensorflow 2.3.1
5. Matplot
